          The second iteration of the match filtering algorithm uses the
          structure of the initial with some improvements. In creating the
          second match filtering algorithm we changed the way the results were
          generated, but the methodology for generating the results remained the
          same. Initially, our algorithm calculated the minimum of the 4
          "quality factors" generated from the know

          The given spreadsheet displays combined human and computer-based
          analysis of which drum kit components are being played during the
          song. The columns labeled kick, snare, crash, and hi-hat all represent
          a human analysis of when each instrument was being played during each
          second, utilizing the individual instrument stems to accomplish this.
          The Y in this section tells that the instrument was playing in the
          second-long interval, whereas the N in the section tells that the
          instrument was not playing the second-long interval. The column
          labeled drum track column is also human-analyzed, as we compared our
          algorithmâ€™s output, a matrix with which instrument is playing, to what
          was actually playing from the other four columns. A Y in this section
          affirms that our algorithm was accurate to what was being played,
          whereas an N represents that our algorithm was not accurate to which
          instrument was being played.

          Overall for the whole drum stem, we got 141 correct predictions out of
          202 seconds of samples. This made for an overall accuracy of 69.8%,
          MUCH better than the 40% we were originally getting on our first try
          with this algorithm. One may notice that there are some discrepancies
          in the data, particularly in sections 69-89, where the hi-hat was in
          fact played, but the drummer used the foot pedal for the hi-hat. We
          did not test for this possibility, which led to some incorrect
          predictions. The section 120-150 is also a source of major
          discrepancies, as the toms, a drum kit component we did not test for,
          was played almost exclusively during this section.
