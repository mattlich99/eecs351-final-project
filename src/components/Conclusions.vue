      All in all, we were able to identify drum kit components from a drum stem
      track with reasonable accuracy. By utilizing digital signal processing
      concepts and algorithms, we delivered a working code sample that can be
      accessed freely in the code section, for any of the viewerâ€™s own drum stem
      tracks. We learned about the intricacies of instrument identification, in
      the real world and in the digital one, bridging the gap between
      qualitative and quantitative characteristics so that components can be
      identified using the data that we hear with our ears and the data that we
      measure using programs like MATLAB. In the end, there is still much to
      learn about specific instruments and their unique characteristics and
      improving our algorithm. However, this project has shed some light on the
      problem of source instrument extraction and we can come to the conclusion
      that with further development of algorithms like ours, source instrument
      extraction is possible.
